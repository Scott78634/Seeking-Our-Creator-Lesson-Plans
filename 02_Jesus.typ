= Prerequisite Assumptions #link(<Index>)[↺]<slide-prerequisites>

- We believe the Bible is true.

- We believe that God is not constrained by the limits of our understanding or experience.

= Preliminary Understanding of "Contradictory"

For two assertions to truly contradict each other:

- They must be asserted about the *same thing*.

- They must be asserted at the *same time*.

- They must be asserted in the *same respect*, *same way*, or from the *same perspective*.

- There is exactly one God.

- There are exactly three persons who are properly called God.

According to this, we have a simple description: *God is an immaterial, tri-personal being*.

Some creedal formulations are much more detailed, but this is perhaps the simplest formulation of what could be called the "Biblical Doctrine of the Trinity" (Dr. William Lane Craig)

= Errors to Avoid (Historic Heresies) #link(<Index>)[↺] <Heresies>

/ Modalism: God as one person manifesting in three roles (e.g., Father, then Son, then Spirit) – Contradicted by simultaneous presence (Jesus' baptism: Matthew 3:16-17).



/ Tritheism: Belief in three separate gods – Rejected; there is only one God (Deuteronomy 6:4).



/ Subordinationism: Inferiority in essence among the Persons – Rejected; all are equally divine in attributes, though distinct in roles.

1 And Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre. And he was sitting in the doorway of the tent at the heat of the day.
2 And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, three men were standing near him. And he saw them and ran from the doorway of the tent to meet them. And he bowed down to the ground.

...

16 Then the men set out from there, and they looked down upon Sodom. And Abraham went with them ⌞to send them on their way⌟.
17 Then Yahweh said, “Shall I conceal from Abraham what I am going to do?

...

20 Then Yahweh said, “Because the outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very ⌞serious⌟,
21 I will go down and I will see. Have they done altogether according to its cry of distress which has come to me? If not, I will know.”
22 And the men turned from there and went toward Sodom. And Abraham was still standing before Yahweh.
23 And Abraham drew near to Yahweh and said, “Will you also sweep away the righteous with the wicked?

John 1:1-18 (LEB)

1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

2 This one was in the beginning with God.

3 All things came into being through him, and apart from him not one thing came into being that has come into being.

4 In him was life, and the life was the light of humanity.

5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.

6 A man came, sent from God, ⌞whose name was⌟ John.

7 This one came for a witness, in order that he could testify about the light, so that all would believe through him.
8 That one was not the light, but came in order that he could testify about the light.

9 The true light, who gives light to every person, was coming into the world.
10 He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, and the world did not recognize him.
11 He came to his own things, and his own people did not receive him.

12 But as many as received him—to those who believe in his name—he gave to them authority to become children of God,
13 who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of a husband, but of God.

14 And the Word became flesh and took up residence among us, and we saw his glory, glory as of the one and only from the Father, full of grace and truth.

15 John testified about him and cried out, saying, “This one was he about whom I said, ‘The one who comes after me is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ ”

16 For from his fullness we have all received, and grace after grace.
17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ.

18 No one has seen God at any time; the one and only, God, the one who is in the bosom of the Father—that one has made him known.

John 1:1-18 is the context for understanding the rest of John

John 14 -- shows God is omnipresent and Omnipotent John 14:13-14

So what does it mean to say the Father is greater than Him?  Jesus is subordinated in role, for a time, and in his human nature -- but not eternally or in his divine nature.

Mark, arguably the earliest Gospel, points to the deity of Jesus

Mark 14:62, Mark 2:10, Mark 2:28

Mark 14:61-62
Dan 7:13 "cloud-rider" 7:14 "glory, authority, sovereign power" "people, nations, and languages serve (Latreuo / Pelach) him" These words for worship are only directed to god. Kingdom never to be destroyed.

Mark 14:32 /Psalm 110:1 -- No one sits next to God!  Moses, Enoch stood.  To sit with him is to rule!

This "Doctrine of the Son of Man" is found in every Gospel and in Paul.

2) The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are clearly distinguished from each other as they interact in personal ways. (Ex Lk 3:22)
3) All three persons are affirmed as fully God. The Father: 1Cor 8:6, 1Pe 1:3, Eph 1:3.  The Son: Jn 1:1, Ro 9:5, Ti 2:13-15, Heb 1:8, 2Pe 1:1, Jn 20:28. The Spirit: Acts 5:1-4

more than one divine person:
- Spirit, distinct from YHWH, but does what only God can do.
- Messenger/Angel of the Lord, not a creature, sent from God, called God, worshiped as God and does what only God does. NOT the Spirit.
- The Word of YHWH, not just his voice or his commands but a messenger sent from God, speaking on God's behalf.
- YHWH sends YHWH

One Eternal being of God... three persons that possess the being of God.

"Being" refers to the state in which someone or something exists.

Not every being is personal.  Everything that exists is a person.

"Person" refers to things like self-awareness, mind, thoughts, emotions.

There are three eternal persons that share in the one being of God.

We tend to limit our idea of what is possible by what we experience.  We don't experience one being that is more than one person.  So we impose the limitation that we experience on our understanding of God.

We assume God is like creation, but He tells us that he is not identical to creation and not like anything in creation.  He transcends "creatureliness".

Ps 89:5-8  Nothing is like God!
